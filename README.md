# Iris Classifier

This project implements a simple classification model using the **Iris dataset** and a **RandomForestClassifier** from scikit-learn.

## How to run

1. Download the code or clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python iris_classifier.py


# Basic Image Processing

This project performs basic image processing tasks using Python and OpenCV. The following operations are done on an image:
- Display the original image.
- Resize the image to 300x300 pixels.
- Convert the image to grayscale.
- Save the resized and grayscale images.

## How to run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install OpenCV by running:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
3. Place an image in the folder with the name input_image.jpg (or modify the script to use a different image path).
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python image_processing.py

## Output 
Two new files will be generated (resized image, and a grayscale image)
